# CareerAccelPython
My Python Jupyter Notebooks from the Global Career Accelerator's Coding for data track, completed Spring 2025.

Projects include basic Python concepts such as functions and loops. Utilized numpy, pandas, and plotly.express libraries to work with datasets from NASA, The Grammy's and Recording Academy, and various small businesses.

Notebooks are located in the milestone folder of each Skillbuilder.
